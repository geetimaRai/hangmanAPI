- What additional properties did you add to your models and why?
 - **User**
    I added the following fields:
    1. won to keep track of the total games won by the user.
    2. total_played to keep track of the total games played by the user.
    3. win_ratio to fetch user rankings for `get_user_rankings` endpoint.

    When fetching the user rankings, if 2 users have the same win_ratio, the
    total games played by each user decides who wins. If player1 and player2 both have 0.25
    as the won ratio and player1 has played 8 games, while player2 has played 16 games,
    player1 wins.

 - **Game**
    - Stores unique game states. Associated with User model via KeyProperty.
    `move_history` stores the history of moves for each game.
    `answer` stores all the correct letters that the players enters while playing the game.
    So if the answer contains an 'a' and the user has already entered the letter, the game
    shows a message that it has been entered already, but the attempts_remaining count does
    not decrease.

 - **Score**
    - Records completed games. Associated with Users model via KeyProperty.

- What were some of the trade-offs or struggles you faced when implementing the new game logic?
